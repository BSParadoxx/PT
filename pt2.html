    If you think I donâ€™t feel, I donâ€™t get hurt, I show no care or love. You are wrong. I canâ€™t show things that I know, you know too. I was getting better with you, also that part of mine was nurturing but at the same time your emotions also was a little bit of problem for me. I always thought I am not able to bring on things you expected. That thing hurted me most of time and thatâ€™s the reason sometimes I did not speak or text you properly. However, this was never going to be big issues like ending up everthing. It was improving from your side as well. I had explained you the day local came to threaten me hahaâ€¦ And on 28th sept when you did the same thing(though that was also the result because of me) and with issues I was going through I become completely lost. Because of family words your emotion got piled up so badly to me and it became another reason for me to think. I could have met you after internals, I think I had told you as well but situation got worse and the weather also had its own plan. Things could have ended nicely but I couldnot show the real me on messages.

  <div id="definition2" class="explanation">
    You have no fault. We must be one who we are. You said you are ready to take risk about the caste. So, on another day I came with the stronger word about problem related to us. The family part is so big Prativa I canâ€™t explain you here properly. You had given me your everything I know that. Nothing about you more, you were too good for me.
  </div>
  
  <div id="definition3" class="explanation">
    At that heat of moment I was completely lost. I had fixed feelings. I wasnâ€™t that much hurt thinking you will not be with me now but this doesnâ€™t mean I didnâ€™t had idea about your suffering. I always think about your feelings. This was for 2-3 days upto the day I was at KU I guess. But when I came home It became so hard for me. And its getting worse for me nowadays.
